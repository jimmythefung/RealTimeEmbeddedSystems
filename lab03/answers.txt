Which tasks, if any, do you anticipate missing their deadlines? Briefly justify.
Hough. Because its utilization is the highest (6/40 = 20%).


For task 8, the full code is executed only every 5th release. Why would we include the wcet of 6 rather than an average over those 5 releases?
Because of the deadline. When you look at averaging you can not tell whether it has missed a deadline or not.
