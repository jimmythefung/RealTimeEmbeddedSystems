Project Title
==============
Customizable Scrolling Text On Matrix LED

Short Description:
-There main interactive component is a 8x8 Matrix LED.

-A user woud be able to paint a picture on the LED and save it. A series of picture can be painted and saved into memory.

-The series of pictures will scroll across the LED matric (when it's set to "playing" mode)

-During painting mode, user selects which LED to paint by using a controller that moves a cursor. The controller is possibly made of 2 potentiometers where one controls the row and the other controls the column.

-The system will have a number of buttons that lets user:
	-select a pixel and commit it (so it becomes part of the picture being painted)
	-save the picture into buffer
	-toggle the matrix LED between "play mode" and "paint mode"
	-reset the system state and buffer

-There will be a numeric display showing 
	-In paint mode: the number of pictures saved to buffer
	-In play mode: the picture number that's being scrolled.

Learning Objective
===================
-Build a complete system made of a number of functionally unique digital peripherals that, collectively, provide practical use case value.
-Learn how each peripheral is integrated into a microcontroller system.


Background Knoweldge
=====================
No previous experiences programming a microcontroller.
Basic understanding of circuitry and wiring on breadboard and familiarity reading datasheet. So I will be able to wire together the neccessary hardware.
Familiar coding in C/C++, so writing the software logic and deploying it to the hardware should be achievable.
